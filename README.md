# Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with LangChain, Gemini 2.0 Flash LLM, and Pinecone

## Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation of a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system using LangChain, Gemini 2.0 Flash LLM, and Pinecone as the vector database. The goal of this project is to enhance the capabilities of large language models by integrating real-time retrieval from external knowledge sources.

## Features
- **LangChain Framework**: Orchestrates the retrieval and generation pipeline.
- **Gemini 2.0 Flash LLM**: Provides state-of-the-art language understanding and generation.
- **Pinecone**: Enables efficient and scalable vector search.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Contains all the implementation details and step-by-step explanations.

## Installation
To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone this notebook:
   ```
   click on the colab notebook link provided in RAG.ipynb
   ```

2.  Set up API keys for Gemini 2.0 Flash LLM and Pinecone:
   ```
   GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key
   PINECONE_API_KEY=your_api_key
   ```
3. Set up Pinecone account:
   You can use your google account for this purpose.

4. Run the Jupyter Notebook:
   Open the notebook and execute the cells sequentially.

## Usage
- The notebook walks through data ingestion, vector embedding, retrieval, and response generation.
- Users can query the system with natural language, and the model retrieves relevant context from Pinecone before generating a response.

## Applications
- AI-powered chatbots
- Enterprise search
- Context-aware assistants
- Knowledge retrieval systems

## Future Improvements
- Expand dataset integration
- Optimize retrieval efficiency
- Experiment with other LLMs and embedding techniques
